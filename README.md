# Forward-Backward-Swept-for-Electrical-Distribution-Systems
MATLAB code for calculate nodal voltages with the Forward-Backward algorithm.
ForwardBackwardDA is a data archive and it must be executed first.
ForwardBackwardM contains the main code with the Forward-Backward algorithm.
This code works for RADIAL Distribution Systems.
